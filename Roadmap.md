### Exploring the Network
- If you had $$n$$ coupon of different colours, how many coupons should one buy, so that one collects all the $$n$$ colors?  
Answer: $$n log n$$   
- This is popularly called the Coupon Collector Problem.
- When we take a random walk on a random graph with $$n$$ nodes, we can cover the entire graph in time $$n log n$$.

### Sampling and Online Hiring
- What is Sampling? It is not always ```More the merrier``` , we should neither over do it nor under do it. 
- Online hiring problem is all about waiting and sampling before jumping to a decision. Neither too less sampling nor too much of sampling is good for us. 
- Good examples where online hiring is in action: Partner selection, hiring, buyig/renting a house.
