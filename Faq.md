**What if I am unable to make it to a class?**

It is important that you dont miss the class. We expect 100% attendance and we incentivise your coming to the class with performance points. 

**I wasn't keeping well and I couldn't manage to attend the class. Can I please not lose my _PP_ ?**

This is a rule across all students and we will not be able to relax it for one student. This rule is in the interest of incentivizing sincerity. One can secure 12.5 marks just through _PPs_. It is important that you dont miss it. If you are very consistent and missed less than 5% classes, we can compensate it with an extra assignment. This compensation is completely left to the discretion of the instructor. In case of emergency, we will go by the rules of the institute.  

**The entire class would request for an off for a genuine reason. Is this possible?**

This will result in the loss of $$ PP $$ for everyone who missed the class.  


**How do I give my best in the course**

Please attend all the classes and labs without fail. Effort required to prepare for the exams, is many folds less, if one regularly attends the class/labs. 

**How are assignments evaluated? Can I collaborate**

You are free to talk to your friends to achieve conceptual clarity, but you shouldn't write anything you dont understand. In case we find you violate the honor code, we will reset your _PP_ to 0.

**I understand we should be on time for the class. How many minutes of delay is allowed?**

We expect you to be in the class before the class commences. Anyone entering the class late will attract -10 _PP_.

**Can we share our _PP_ with others**

Yes, only if you cross 100 and only the extra $PP$ beyond 100 can be shared. 

**What is the maximum _PP_ one can accumulate?**

One can accumulate as much _PP_ as it is possible, but anything greater than 100, will not count towards your marks. 

**My friend told me that s/he will share their _PP_ but is denying it in the last minute. Can I complain to the instructor?**

The promises on exchanging _PPs_ is completely between the students, the Professor and TAs will not be involved in anyway.

**How do I share my feedback with the instructor?**

We have a link to a google form which can be used to share your feedback with the instructor. This will be an anonymous form.

**What is the prescribed textbook for the course?**

There is no prescribed text for the course. You should use the content given on the course homepage.
