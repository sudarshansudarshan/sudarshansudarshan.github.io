# Practice Questions 1

1. There are $$n$$ nodes in a graph $$\{v_1,v_2,...,v_n\}$$. At any point of time, when you are taking a random walk, the probability of you reaching $$v_i$$ is $$p_i$$. What is the expected number of steps your random walk takes to cover all the nodes.   
>Hint: We are not expecting the exact answer, it is enough if you can give a good upper bound.

2. In the online hiring problem, write a program to find out the expected rank of the person you will be recruiting, if you were to sample till $$k=\frac{n}{e}$$. 

3. In the online hiring problem, write a program to find out the expected rank of the person you will be recruiting, if you were to sample till $$k$$, in general. 
>Display the plot, with $$k$$ in the X axis and the expected rank in the Y axis. 
4. Investigate on the average shortest path length, diameter, highest degree, least degree as you increase the $$p$$ value in a _Random Graph_ (aka _Erdos-Renyi-graph_).

5. Investigate on the average shortest path length, diameter, highest degree, least degree as you increase the $$k$$ value in a _Scale Free Network_ (aka _Barabasi-Albert-Graph_).

6. Investigate on the average shortest path length, diameter, highest degree, least degree as you vary the $$k$$ and $$p$$ values in a _Small World Network_ (aka _Watts-Strogratz-Graph_).


7. Consider a $$2X2$$ matrix. Keep applying it on a non-zero column vector and keep normalizing it. We are concerned about its direction and not its magnitude. Do you observe that the direction converges? Is this always true? Can you consider an example of a matrix where this is not true?

# Practice Questions 2

1. What is the coupon collector problem? How is it related to a random walk ona  graph? (Theory)

2. Consider a path of length 10 $$\{v_1,v_2,...,v_10\}$$. Take a random walk on this path for over a million steps and plot the visits to the nodes with $$a_is$$ on the X-axis & the number of visits on the Y-axis. What do you observe? (Lab)

3. Consider a random graph G(V,E) with edge probability $$p$$. Define the presence of an edge as positive relationship and absence of an edge as negative relationship. Count the total number of unbalanced triangles. Plot unbalanced triangles Vs $$p$$. What do you observe? (Lab).

4. Given an example of two graphs that have the same degree sequence, but different closeness centrlaity ranks (Theory).

5. What is the pagerank index of a node which doesn't have any incoming edges? Explain! (Theory).

6. Create a graph with $$n$$ vertices, with 2 nodes $$x$$ & $$y$$ such that: $$deg(x)>deg(y)$$, but $$pagerank(x)$$ is not ranked higher than $$pagerank(y)$$. (Lab)

7. Give an example of an application of a network where edges follow homophily (Theory).

8. Construct a graph $$G$$ with $$k$$ number of communities and use Girvan Newmann's algorithm to detect it (Theory/Lab).

9. Watch the documentary fully, there can be questions based on the documentary in theory/lab.
